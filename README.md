jhPrimeminer
============

An attempt at porting jhPrimeminer to *nix/osx. Very early stages, slightly working state.

To build from source you need openssl and libgmp

To install it, just run make in the root dir of the project, note: you need gnu make, so if you're on FreeBSD you need to use 'gmake'. You should then get a jhprimeminer binary in that same folder.

I've managed to compile it on OSX 10.8.4, FreeBSD 9.2 (64 bit), Ubuntu 12.10 (32/64 bit), Raspbian (armhf). 20ish 4 chains/h such an awe-inspiring monster of a machine! :D
