jhPrimeminer
============

An attempt at porting jhPrimeminer to *nix/osx. Very early stages, slightly working state.

To build from source you need openssl and libgmp

I've managed to compile it on OSX 10.8.x, FreeBSD 9.x (64 bit) and failed miserably on ubuntu 12.10 (32 bit), but it builds and runs on the raspberry pi. 20ish 4 chains/h such an awe-inspiring monster of a machine! :D
